# Mastodon Modern  <a href="https://nogithub.codeberg.page"><img src="https://nogithub.codeberg.page/badge.svg" alt="Please don't upload to GitHub"></a>
A UserStyle & theme that drastically improves the look & feel of Mastodon. Can be used with other themes that only change colors.

### **[Use with the Stylus browser extension!](https://userstyles.world/style/4773)**

**WARNING: Glitch-soc & its derivatives are not supported.** Too many things I would have to change to support it :(


## Example for adding to your own instance:

https://github.com/Coffeedon/Cofffee-Assets#to-use-a-pre-made-theme

- **Make sure to use the compiled code from [this repo's `modern.css`](modern.css)**
- **For light theme, you may need to include `@import 'mastodon-light/diff';`**
- **Same goes for the High Contrast theme `@import 'contrast/diff';`**
- While not tested thoroughly, could work well with other color themes, as well. 

**Note:** The UserStyle usually receives updates earlier to make sure everything is ready for the compiled CSS.
